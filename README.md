### About The Project  
**Mobius Project** is an **open-source initiative** built with dedication and shared vision. Unlike commercial projects, we operate on a simple principle:  
> **"All contributions are voluntary, all code is free, all development is driven by passion."**  

We believe in creating meaningful solutions without financial barriers, fostering a community where everyone can learn, contribute, and grow together.

### Our Core Principles  
- **100% Free Development** – No paid features, no premium tiers  
- **Community First** – Decisions driven by community needs  
- **Open Source** – Transparent and accessible to all  
- **Innovation Through Collaboration** – Better together
